# gh-blog
Minimalistic blog over GitHub's Issues

I got this idea to use Github's Issues for personal notes and blog from https://github.com/rainyear/lolita.
So I changed my blog to use Github's Issue API and host through gh-pages.
At the end of the day I can host my blog for free and conviniently using git and markdown.

# Use
If you'd like to use it you can simply:

1. Clone it

2. `bower intall`

3. Make necessary changes to `config.json`

3. Push it to a repo of your choice
